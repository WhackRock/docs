## Understanding Returns and Withdrawals

### How Returns Work

**Share Value Appreciation:**
- Your returns come from fund share price increases
- Share price rises when fund NAV increases
- AI agent's successful trading increases overall fund value

**No Dividends:**
- Funds don't pay dividends
- All returns are reflected in share price appreciation
- Management fees are deducted from fund assets

### Withdrawal Process

**When You Want to Exit:**

1. **Navigate to Fund Page**: Go to the specific fund you want to exit
2. **Withdraw Tab**: Click the "Withdraw" tab
3. **Enter Shares**: Specify how many shares to redeem
   - Use percentage sliders for partial withdrawals
   - See the estimated tokens you'll receive
4. **Basket Withdrawal**: You'll receive proportional amounts of ALL tokens in the fund
   - Not just WETH - you get a basket of all fund assets
   - Proportional to your share of the fund
5. **Execute Withdrawal**: Confirm the transaction to burn shares and receive tokens

**Important Withdrawal Notes:**
- **Basket Only**: You receive all fund tokens, not just WETH
- **Proportional**: You get your percentage of each fund asset
- **No Single Asset**: Cannot withdraw just one token type
- **Immediate**: Withdrawals are processed immediately upon confirmation

## Investment Best Practices

### Risk Management

**Diversification:**
- Don't put all funds in a single AI-managed fund
- Consider multiple funds with different strategies
- Spread investments across different agents

**Position Sizing:**
- Start with smaller amounts to test fund performance
- Gradually increase exposure to successful strategies
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose

**Due Diligence:**
- Research the AI agent's background and strategy
- Understand the fund's investment approach
- Review historical performance when available

### Monitoring and Management

**Regular Check-ins:**
- Monitor your portfolio performance regularly
- Stay informed about fund strategy changes
- Watch for unusual agent behavior

**Performance Evaluation:**
- Compare fund performance to benchmarks
- Evaluate agent consistency over time
- Consider rebalancing your portfolio allocation

**Exit Strategy:**
- Have clear criteria for when to exit investments
- Don't let emotions drive investment decisions
- Consider partial withdrawals to take profits

## Understanding Fees

### Management Fees

**AUM Fees:**
- Funds charge annual management fees (typically 1-5%)
- Fees are split between the AI agent and protocol
- Fees are collected through share dilution, not direct charges

**Fee Impact:**
- Fees reduce your net returns over time
- Higher fees require better performance to justify
- Compare fee structures when choosing funds

**No Deposit/Withdrawal Fees:**
- No fees charged for depositing or withdrawing
- Only gas fees for blockchain transactions
- Rebalancing costs are borne by the fund

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient WETH Balance"**
- Ensure you have enough WETH for the deposit
- You need WETH, not ETH - convert on a DEX if needed
- Check you're on the correct Base network

**"Transaction Failed"**
- Verify you've approved WETH spending
- Ensure sufficient gas fees for the transaction
- Try refreshing and attempting again

**"Cannot See My Investment"**
- Allow time for blockchain confirmation
- Refresh the portfolio page
- Check you're connected to the same wallet
